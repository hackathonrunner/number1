Liz, I'm so sorry for having been late the past couple of days. Before my br=
other was in his car accident I had no problem or event that would keep me f=
rom coming on time. I have been trying to juggle being there for my brother a=
nd parents, and also being able to get to work on time. That is my fault and=
 I'm so sorry. I really enjoy working with you and being on the team and beg=
 you to reconsider and give me another shot. I realize that being late becau=
se of some other situation is no excuse and promise that if you reconsider, a=
nd keep me on the team that I will no longer be late at all and explain to m=
y family that I can not be available at all during my scheduled time with yo=
u. I would really love to stay on the team and if you reconsider and give me=
 a second chance I promise you that I will never be late again and that no o=
ther situation, no matter how personal it may be, will interfere with gettin=
g to your house on time. If you choose to stick with your decision I will un=
derstand but be very sad that I failed you and the rest of the team. I look f=
orward to hearing back from you, thanks! =20
