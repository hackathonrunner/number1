Hi, my name is Austin Dreier and i saw your ad on craigslist for the 4br hom=
e. I currently live here in steamboat at the Xanadu Condo complex in clock t=
ower square off of Burguss Creek Rd. Recently all of the tenets in our compl=
ex, including myself, have been told to leave because of faulty electrical w=
ork. Due to the bad electrical system in the complex the city is essentially=
 condemning the building. Everyone has been given only 7 days to vacate the b=
uilding. This has put a huge stress on all of us here to find new places to l=
ive. I would love to set up a showing and potentially move in as soon as pos=
sible if the home is still available for rent! If you could give me a call a=
t your earliest convenience, i'd love to learn more about the home and talk w=
ith you about potentially signing a lease! I have 3 other roommates one of t=
hem being my brother. We have no dogs and none of us smoke. My cell phone nu=
mber is (404) 384 2344. I look forward to your call.

Thank you!
-Austin Dreier
