Dr Smart, I am going to need you help with some things in the near future. I=
 don't know if you have heard by now or not, but Mountian view apartments, s=
pecifically my very apartment, burned down. I lost everything I own to the f=
ire including all of my medication. I don't know what to do. If possible, ca=
n you please call me tomorrow at 404 384 2344 so we can talk about what to d=
o and what happened. I am very traumatized at the moment so please excuse ho=
w odd this email may sound, but I don't have a home anymore or any possessio=
ns so I am pretty upset. Anyway, if you can, please email me back or call me=
 so I can get this worked out because I have quite a bit of anxiety and back=
 pain from everything that has happened and no way of relieving any of it. T=
hank you for your help in the past and I look forward to hearing from you.=20=
