So basically, after 10-12 weeks of using a base test at (500-750mg) per week=
 stacked with some other compound, say dbol, you would then lower your base t=
est down from 500-750mg a week to like, 150-200mg a week for, I don't know, s=
ay 3-4 weeks, and then jump right back into a high dose (500-750mg) test cyc=
le (using a different type of testosterone of course) stacked with some othe=
r compound, say maybe deca? And then just repeat the process after the 10-12=
 weeks of that cycle?
