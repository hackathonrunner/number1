Hello Professors,

On Wednesday and Thursday of this week I was absent from your classes. I wan=
ted to touch base with all of you and explain why I was absent. On Tuesday m=
orning I had to fly to my home in Denver to deal with some legal issues I've=
 been having. I had to appear in court on Wednesday the 22nd and because of t=
hat I had to miss Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday classes. Regarding the ho=
mework that was due on those days, I have completed it and will turn it in o=
n Monday if you will accept it. I will send another email, right after this o=
ne, a copy of my plane tickets and a statement from the Colorado courts to s=
how that I was actually in Colorado for a court appearance. If I can get the=
 absences excused and still turn in the assignments from those days it would=
 be greatly appreciated! If you have any questions regarding my situation, p=
lease feel free to ask. My email addresses are austindreier@gmail.com and au=
stindreier@icloud.com.. My cell phone number is 404 384 2344, feel free to c=
all or email at anytime. Thank you so much for understanding as I deal with t=
his rather stressful situation.=20
