 don't think I will be able to reach him in time, so I thought I would see i=

st. Just let me know if this is possible or not because I will be running ou=
t of those on the 28th of this month and at that point I'll already be out o=
f the country. If need be, I could always come to your office to pick up a p=
aper prescription if those can not be called in. I don't know how the proces=
s really works. Anyway, thank you again for all your help!
