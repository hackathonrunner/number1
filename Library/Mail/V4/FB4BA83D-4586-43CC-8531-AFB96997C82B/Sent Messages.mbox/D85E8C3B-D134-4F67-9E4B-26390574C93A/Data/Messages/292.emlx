Ok, so will the 285$ cover the dbol, Cyp., and EQ I will need for a full 10w=
k cycle?=20

I'm guessing that I would get 50tabs of Dbol, two Bottles of test cyp. And t=
wo bottles of EQ, right? or just one bottle of EQ?=20

I would imagine that if I'm going to run the EQ for as long as I run the Cyp=
. I'm gonna need more than just one 10ml vial.., right?=20

Or is the dosing protocol less for the EQ so I don't have to use as much of i=
t?=20
Sorry, I'm just trying to clarify what exactly id be getting and if it will b=
e enough to properly run a 10wk cycle.=20

Thanks for your help Steve!
