Hi, my name is Austin Dreier and I am a returning transfer student. I am try=
ing to make sure I have everything in order for this upcoming quarter and wa=
s curious about the status of my financial clearance. I have a privet sallie=
 Mae loan that has been approved and was wondering if you have received any i=
nformation about that loan. I would like to make a payment so I can get clea=
rance and I will only be able to do that with the money from that loan. If y=
ou could let me know if there is anything more I need to do in order to help=
 the process along please let me know. My id number is 1492991 and my cell p=
hone number is 404 384 2344. Please feel free to email me back or call me wi=
th any information on my financial status. Thank you! =20
