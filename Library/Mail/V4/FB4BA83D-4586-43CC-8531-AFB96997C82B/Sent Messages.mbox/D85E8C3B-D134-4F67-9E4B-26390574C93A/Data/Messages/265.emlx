Sorry for email blasting you here, I just thought of another question =
right after i sent that last email=E2=80=A6 Anyway, i was curious about =
the accuracy of the dosage in the Alpha Test. Ent. vials. Im going to =
push 750mg a week and was wondering how accurate the vials are so i can =
make sure im taking exactly 750mg and not under dosing below 750mg or =
over dosing beyond the 750mg that I would like to take.
=20
I=E2=80=99ll get that 25$ that i owe in the mail asap if i decide =
against the Dbol because of the price.

Anyway, thanks! And again im sorry for the email blast..=
