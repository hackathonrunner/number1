The bike is still for sale and I am willing to selling for $150 dollars. I m=
ight negotiate the price but that price is already 60% off what it sells for=
 online. you mentioned that you wanted to see more pictures and I can send t=
hem to you if you like. How many more pictures would you like me to send. Is=
 there anything in particular you would like me to take a picture of?
