Hi, I saw the ad on Craigslist for the bakery position. I am currently looki=
ng for a more consistent full time position and have been browsing baker pos=
itions because I love the work! I have over a year experience working in a b=
akery setting as the head baker for Milk Run Donuts and Cafe in Steamboat Sp=
rings. It was probably the most enjoyable job I've had, and was sad to leave=
 but had to move from Steamboat to Loveland where I currently am. After read=
ing the description for the position I thought I would send an email with my=
 resume because I know I am the perfect fit for the job and believe that bec=
ause of my experience and love of the bakery setting that I would be a valua=
ble asset to your team. I would really love to learn more about your operati=
on and get to know the team! Please email me back or call me at 4043842344 a=
nytime, I can't wait to hear from you and am eager to set something up, than=
k you!=20
