Hi Steve, I found your email address on the Black Bottle website and saw tha=
t you are the man to contact for brewery operations. I figured that that may=
 mean you would know wether or not there are any positions open or available=
 to fill? I filled out the entire application and also have a pretty impress=
ive resume, in my humble opinion, to go along with it. I just don't know wha=
t to write down at the top of the first page in the "Position Applying For" s=
ection. I figured I'd shoot one of you guys an email and see what's availabl=
e, then possibly head out your way and drop in to talk and hand in my applic=
ation and resume! Anyway, sorry if you are not the right person to be asking=
, just figured I'd start with the operations man first. Feel free to email m=
e back and let me know the situation regarding employment. Thanks again!=20
