Hey man, I saw the ad you posted on Craigslist regarding your need to find a=
 room mate, and after reading what you had to say I thought I would send you=
 an email because I am also looking for a room to rent in the area where you=
 are located, and really do believe I would be a perfect fit/housemate. My n=
ame is Austin Dreier, and I am 24 years old, so we are right about the same a=
ge. I also just recently graduated from The University of Washington in Seat=
tle, WA as a financial investments major and decided to move back to Colorad=
o to be closer to my family. I am a super clean guy, always have been, and w=
ouldn't have a problem with paying any of the upfront=20
move-in costs, or paying for the rent every month, on time. I currently work=
 in the marketing and advertising division for a company by the name of JAA S=
pecialty Woods. A wholesale distributor of fine woods and lumber that supply=
 the materials needed for carpenters and the cured wood needed by many resta=
urants in and around the Loveland/Fort Collins area. I'd love to set up a ti=
me to meet if the room is still available so that we can get to know each ot=
her and see if we would make good room mates! My cell phone number is (404) 3=
84-2344, feel free to give me a call or shoot me a text anytime and I'll try=
 my best to respond as quickly as I can. Anyway, I hope to hear from you soo=
n and learn more about yourself and the house. Hope you have a great day!=20=
