Hey Professor Ewer,

I'm not going to be making it to class today because I'm actually on my way t=
o saint Mary's hospital right now to get another injection in my lower spine=
 for my pain. I've been having a very very bad pain day and I decided to go g=
et this injection because the other alternative would be to take 3x the reco=
mmended dose of my pain medication and I wouldn't  be able to retain anythin=
g from the lesson in class today anyway.

Once I'm done at the hospital though, I'll be meeting up with Josh Denny, my=
 math tutor, and going over today's lesson and completing the webwork that i=
s  due tonight.=20

Also, Josh and I have already started studying and practicing for the upcomi=
ng exam on the 5th so I feel I will be more prepared for it.=20
In addition, Im going to talk to the disabilities services here on campus ab=
out getting more time for my tests, not just in your class, but In all of my=
 classes due to the fact that I do have ADHD and because of that I have a ha=
rd time finishing anything on time.=20
im sure the disability service will allow it, which means you won't have to s=
tay longer after class to let me finish a test anymore, someone would superv=
ise me in a separate room and give me as much time as I need to complete the=
 test properly, which will help my grade go up as well since I won't feel pr=
essured by a time constraint and skip or rush through problems that I more t=
han likely know how to do.=20

Anyway, I just wanted to let you know what was going on today. I can bring y=
ou a doctors note if you like. But like I said, I will be covering the lesso=
n and studying/doing webwork with Josh when I'm through at Saint Mary's with=
 the injections.=20

Thanks for understanding!=20
