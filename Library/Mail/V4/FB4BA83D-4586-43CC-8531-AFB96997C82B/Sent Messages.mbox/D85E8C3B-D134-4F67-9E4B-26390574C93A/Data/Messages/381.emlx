Hi Marilyn, I just wanted to let you know that I did sign the waiver that Ra=
chael needed and I sent it off in the mail. If there is anything else that R=
achael needs from me please have her call me at 404 384 2344 anytime during t=
he day or evening. Also, I was wanting to know if scanning the signed waiver=
 of appearance onto the computer and emailing it to you would be sufficient,=
 or if you needed the copy to have a fresh signature on it.=20

      <pre>Hello, Austin,

Thank you for your signed SOC, which arrived at our office on Saturday 
March 26, postmarked in Denver on the 22nd. Still outstanding is your 
declaration waiving your right to be present at the hearing at which 
Rachel will hand up the SOC. I have scanned it here for your printing 
and signing, or alternatively you may still have the hard copy we sent 
by US Mail.

Rachel also reminds you that your $100.00 monitoring fee will need to be 
in hands of the court before that hearing can be conducted. If this is 
still pending, please mail in a money order in that amount, made out to 
the Walla Walla County District Court and addressed to same at 317 W. 
Rose, Walla Walla, WA 99362. Be sure to reference your case number 
C68977 on the money order.

Your hearing has been set out to April 14th at 9 AM. We hope you're 
doing well and can resolve this matter at that time.

Marilyn
