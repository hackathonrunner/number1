I already emailed the landlord and it's been taken already. That would have b=
een the perfect place to live. I got accepted into Western Washington Univer=
sity in Bellingham, maybe I should move to Bellingham and live in EIO's apar=
tment. I know she would let me stay there. She has always wanted me to go th=
ere, and she could see me all the time. Haha it's just a thought though. But=
 I did find out I got accepted into the school this morning. I'm kind of pro=
ud of that. It's not a super easy school to get into, and it's well known fo=
r the business program there
