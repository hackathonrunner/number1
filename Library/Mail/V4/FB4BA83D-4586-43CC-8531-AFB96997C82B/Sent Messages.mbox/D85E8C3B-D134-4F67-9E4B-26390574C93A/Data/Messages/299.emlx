,<br>
<br>
Got a question for you. Im about to end a 9 week Test Ent. Cycle and i have t=
he stuff needed to PCT properly but im highly considering just jumping right=
 into another cycle. Do you recommend that i just go ahead and start my PCT o=
f Nolvadex 12 days after my last injection, or is it possible to slowly tape=
r off of the Test ENT. and then Jump right into a new 9-12 week Dbol / Test C=
yp. cycle? I would rather start a brand new cycle instead of PCTing and havi=
ng to wait weeks before i can cycle again because i didnt make the best of g=
ains on this Test Ent. Cycle... But that was due to the fact that my diet wa=
s poor and my training time in the gym could have been much better. The only=
 reason my diet was shit and i wasnt training hard/often enough was because o=
f my living situation. But im going to be in a much much better living situa=
tion in about 4 days so i will be able to have a perfect diet and train like=
 a beast almost everyday.. Im just looking for advice here. I cant really fi=
nd anything online and any help or info you can give me would be great!<br>
<br>
Also, if it is possible to just jump right onto another cycle, what would yo=
u recommend? im 25yr old 5 foot 9 inches 195lb&nbsp; Approx. 11-12% BF and i=
ve only ever used Test while cycling. No other compounds. First Cycle was a 1=
0wk Test Cyp. at 500mg a wk cycle, and my second cycle, the one im on now, i=
s gonna be almost a 10wk Test Ent. cycle at 500mg per wk.<br>
<br>
Any thoughts? Ideas? Gear recommendations?<br>
<br>
Thanks man!<br>
