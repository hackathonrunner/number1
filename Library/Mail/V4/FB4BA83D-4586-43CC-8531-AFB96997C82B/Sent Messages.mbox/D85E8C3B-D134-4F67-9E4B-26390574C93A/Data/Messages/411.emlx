HI Kathy,

My name is Austin, owner/operator of Northern Colorado Moving & =
Logistics, and I would like to offer you our services in regards to the =
job order you posted here on Thumbtack. What I've gathered from your job =
request is that you only need to have a couple things relocated within =
your home, and not moved to a different location. Since you don't =
require the use of a moving truck, and because it will take a relatively =
short amount of time to complete your job, I am able to offer you our =
competitive fixed rate of $250.00 for the entire job.

I like to inform our potential clients that the rate stated is by no =
means the final quoted rate. Unfortunately, Thumbtack does not do a very =
good job of providing enough information when it comes to the job orders =
that are sent out. This means that the rate quoted to you is just an =
estimate, and may very well be lowered with a little more information =
about the job as a whole.=20

So, I would love the opportunity to speak with you about the specifics =
of what you need moved so that I can give you a more accurate, and more =
than likely, lower quoted rate! Feel free to call us anytime so that we =
can talk about what exactly you need done, and find out if we can lower =
the fixed rate for your job, our business line is (970) 308 4986. I =
eagerly look forward to speaking with you, and hope you choose Northern =
Colorado Moving & Logistics as your professional moving service =
provider, thank you!=
