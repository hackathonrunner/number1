Doctor smart, I have been trying to get ahold of my other doctor, Dr. Barton=
 Moore to get my pain medication refilled as well for this trip but I haven'=
t been able to reach him, or my specialist, Dr. Adam Zerinberg, even though m=
y specialist isn't my main prescriber. You have given me a refill on that me=
dication in the past, would you be able to give me a refill on that medicati=
on? I receive a months worth prescription on the 29th of every month, and ha=
ve been trying to contact Dr. Barton Moore to get that taken care of but I d=
on't think I will be able to reach him in time, so I thought I would see if t=
hat is possible to do through you since you have done it for me in the past.=
 Just let me know if this is possible or not because I will be running out o=
f those on the 28th of this month and at that point I'll already be out of t=
he country. If need be, I could always come to your office to pick up a pape=
r prescription if those can not be called in. I don't know how the process r=
eally works. Anyway, thank you again for all your help!=20
