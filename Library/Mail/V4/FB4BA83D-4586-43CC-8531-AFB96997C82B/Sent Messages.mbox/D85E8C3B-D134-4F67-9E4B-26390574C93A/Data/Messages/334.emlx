Hey Dr. Smart,

I'm at Walmart right now trying to fill my prescription for my adderrall and=
 they are giving me a hard time, again, since I'm trying to fill it today. T=
he last time I filled this prescription was before my vacation on June 26th a=
nd I am now out of my adderrall and it's the 28th, more than a month has pas=
t but they still won't fill the prescription because it has "Aug 2015" writt=
en on the script. Can you call them please and tell them that you know about=
 the situation so I can fill this prescription.=20
