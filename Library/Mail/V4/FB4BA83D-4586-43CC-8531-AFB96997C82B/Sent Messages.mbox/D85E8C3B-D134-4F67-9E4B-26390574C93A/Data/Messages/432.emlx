You have got to be kidding me. I take deposits over the phone from my client=
s who are booking a moving date with my company. I do this to ensure they do=
 not back out. This is ridiculous, especially after trying to complete an in=
stant deposit transfer to my account for 4 days straight. Also the money tha=
t you are "holding" for 90 days is deposit money sent to me by my clients, w=
illingly, so that I can purchase the equipment needed to complete their move=
. This incredibly detrimental to my business and you need to know that you a=
re crippling my small moving business / operation. If you are going to deact=
ivate my account and leave me without a means of accepting payment from my c=
lients, then the money that I earned which is still in my Square account nee=
ds to be sent to me immediately! If you feel the need to verify with my clie=
nts that the payments and transactions are legitimate than please do so. As a=
 small business owner running a local moving company, I CAN NOT afford to ha=
ve the money that I earned honestly, be held for 90 days when the sole purpo=
se of requesting those deposits was so that I could get the equipment I need=
 to complete my clients job request!! You need to FIX THIS!=20
