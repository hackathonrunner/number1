Alright Steve, I just sent out $140.00 to Fowlers Merchandise 111 E. Univers=
ity Dr. Suite 105 #182 Denton, TX. 76209.=20

I sent it through FedEx because I was there shipping a package to my brother=
 and thought it would just be easier and faster to send you the money right t=
hen and there. Anyway, my address is 2829 Kyle Cir. Loveland, Colorado 80537=
 and I'm just getting two (2) 10ml vials of the Alpha 6 TEST E. 250mg=20

I'm hoping you get the money fast so the gear is sent out soon. Thanks so mu=
ch for hooking it up again. That last cycle of GE-TM TEST CYP 250mg was awes=
ome!=20
Feel free to email me if there are any problems. I look forward to trying ou=
t your own personal brand!!

Thanks!=20
