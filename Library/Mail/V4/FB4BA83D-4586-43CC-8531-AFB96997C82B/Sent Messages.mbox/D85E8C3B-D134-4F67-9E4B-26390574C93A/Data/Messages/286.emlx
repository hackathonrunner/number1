Hey steve,

Got a question for you. Im about to end a 9 week Test Ent. Cycle and i =
have the stuff needed to PCT properly but im highly considering just =
jumping right into another cycle. Do you recommend that i just go ahead =
and start my PCT of Nolvadex 12 days after my last injection, or is it =
possible to slowly taper off of the Test ENT. and then Jump right into a =
new 9-12 week Dbol / Test Cyp. cycle? I would rather start a brand new =
cycle instead of PCTing and having to wait weeks before i can cycle =
again because i didnt make the best of gains on this Test Ent. Cycle... =
But that was due to the fact that my diet was poor and my training time =
in the gym could have been much better. The only reason my diet was shit =
and i wasnt training hard/often enough was because of my living =
situation. But im going to be in a much much better living situation in =
about 4 days so i will be able to have a perfect diet and train like a =
beast almost everyday.. Im just looking for advice here. I cant really =
find anything online and any help or info you can give me would be =
great!

Also, if it is possible to just jump right onto another cycle, what =
would you recommend? im 25yr old 5 foot 9 inches 195lb  Approx. 11-12% =
BF and ive only ever used Test while cycling. No other compounds. First =
Cycle was a 10wk Test Cyp. at 500mg a wk cycle, and my second cycle, the =
one im on now, is gonna be almost a 10wk Test Ent. cycle at 500mg per =
wk.

Any thoughts? Ideas? Gear recommendations?

Thanks man!
