Cool. So is it true that you test Cyp. Is now rated at 300mg/1ml coming in 1=
0ml vials? If so, I think I'm gonna place an order for two (2) 10ml vials of=
 the Test Cyp. And also 1 order of your cheapest D-Bol package.=20

Think I should throw in some Deca or either epiquose along with that cycle?=20=


I have one does left of my Test Ent. And no Nolvadex or clomid because someo=
ne jacked my whole PCT..=20

So I either jump on a stronger cycle, or I buy another PCT protocol asap.=20=


What do you think?=20
