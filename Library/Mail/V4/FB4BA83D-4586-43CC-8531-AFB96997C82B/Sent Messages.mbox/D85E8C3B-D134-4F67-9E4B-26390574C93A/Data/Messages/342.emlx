Mom take a look at this place. I know where the house is located and it is i=
n a nice area. It seems like a nice house too and it SUPER CHEAP! I would be=
 willing to live here, and it's also really close to the community college. I=
t's probably a 15min walk give or take to the college. Take a look at it and=
 tell me what you think.=20
