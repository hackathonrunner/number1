Hi, Professor Ewer, I was going over webwork 4.2 today with my tutor Josh to=
day and he explained everything to me and I completely understand the lesson=
 which is great! He is an amazing math tutor. Unfortunately I spent most of t=
he day at Adventist Health getting injections into my lower S1 vertebrae so I=
 have had limited time to do any of my school work today. I just woke up fro=
m sleeping because I was heavily sedated while I was getting the work done o=
n my back and don't have enough time   Or a clear enough head to finish the 4=
,2 webwork. I was hoping you would be able to extend 4.2 for me until tomorr=
ow at 5 right before class starts so I can actually do the work. I have been=
 looking at my grade and in order to pass the class I need to get a 100% on a=
ll the upcoming webwork and also get a good grade on the next test. I don't n=
eed a full days extension on 4.2 but just enough time to be able
To do it before class tomorrow so
I don't lose the points. If you could do that for me it would
Be a great help and I would really appreciate it! I'm trying so hard
To keep all of my medical issues from effecting my school work and grades an=
d if possible I would love an extension on 4.2. I know and understand the ma=
terial, I just need a bit more time to do it. Please let me know as soon as p=
ossible if you will allow this for me just this once. That way when I get up=
 in the morning I can start on it.=20

Thank you so much for your support and understand!
