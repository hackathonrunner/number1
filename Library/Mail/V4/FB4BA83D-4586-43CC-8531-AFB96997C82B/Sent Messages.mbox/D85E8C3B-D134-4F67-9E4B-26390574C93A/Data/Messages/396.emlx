> Please consider this your last warning in regards to the payment of the $1=
00 SOC administrative fee. As of today, you have not paid the $100 and have f=
ailed to respond to my emails, which inquire about the fee.  I cannot enter t=
he SOC without the $100 and cannot continue this case over any longer.  Plea=
se respond to this email by either calling me or return email, so that we ca=
n discuss the fee.  If I do not hear from you by May 12th, I will be forced t=
o inform the court that I have not had any recent contact from you and a war=
rant for your arrest will likely be issued. If you pay the $100 to the court=
 or get in contact with me, I may be able to stop a warrant from being issue=
d.=20

 that to me.  The last thing we are missing is the $100 administrative fee. =
 The $100 is due on date of entry, which means I cannot file this paperwork u=

 you have questions regarding the $100 administrative fee.=20
