Hey man, thanks for shipping out the gear so fast. I ended up moving =
before i could get the delievery so i had to have the gear shipped to me =
at my new address from my old one in Colorado. Due to that, I just got =
the gear and i see that you sent me 3 bottle of the test ent. instead of =
the 2 that i fully paid for. You said i had a credit of 30$ so i owe you =
25$ since you went ahead and sent the 3rd bottle with the order. I =
appreciate it. Im thinking about stacking this cycle with some Dbol. Do =
you have any in stock? If so, Ill purchase an order from you and send =
you the 25$ I owe you with the money for the dbol. How much is an order =
of Dbol?=20

Glad to see that the store is back up and running with your new Alpha =
line. I was wanting to put in another order. I really enjoyed the GE-TM =
products when they were in stock but id like to try out your Alpha 6 =
line. If its in stock, i would like to place an order for two (2) 10ml =
vials of Sustenon, two (2) 10ml vials of the Alpha 6 DECA, and one (1) =
order of the dianabol tabs.<br class=3D"">
<br class=3D"">

Obviously im not sending cash to the same address anymore since you =
moved so let me know where to send the payment as soon as you can so i =
can send you the cash.&nbsp; </blockquote></div><br class=3D""></div>
