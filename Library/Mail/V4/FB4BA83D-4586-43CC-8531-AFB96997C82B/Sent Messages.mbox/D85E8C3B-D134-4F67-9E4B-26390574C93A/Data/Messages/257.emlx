Ok great. If I send the money and if they give me a tracking number I'll imm=
ediately send it to you. If that's the case, and I do get a tracking number,=
 is it possible for you to put that third bottle in the same package as the o=
ther two so they all ship as one and I don't have to wait any extra amount o=
f time for it. You will have the tracking number so you will know that I act=
ually sent the cash and its on its way to you. THe only reason I'm asking th=
is is because I'm moving to Washington on January 3rd. I'm finishing my last=
 year of college in Seattle and I would rather get all the gear before I dri=
ve off to Seattle so it doesn't arrive to the address I gave you wi me being=
 gone. One, because is is my parents house and two, because I don't want to h=
ave to wait another week for it to ship from Colorado to Washington, I'd lik=
e to start the cycle right away. Anyway, sorry for the back story, just want=
ed to explain my situation. I would really appreciate if that is possible bu=
t if not, no worries I understand. Just let me know. Thanks!=20

P.s. I'm going to send the 25$ tomorrow afternoon. I'll let you know and sen=
d you the tracking number when it's mails off.=20
