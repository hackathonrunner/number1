Hey professor Ewer, sorry I was absent from class today. I wanted to email y=
ou and let you know I was getting a second MRI done on my lower spine. As of=
 yesterday I decided to hire a tutor for your class so I won't fall to behin=
d after seeing my test score. Although it was better than my last score a 68=
% is still unacceptable to me and I have to pass you class so I will be meet=
ing with my tutor in 30 min to go over today's lesson 4.3. I will also be re=
viewing 4.1 and 4.2 with him. I feel like I am starting to grasp these conce=
pts better but I need to master them so
I can get better test scores and pass the class. Anyway, I just wanted to to=
uch base with you and let you know the situation.=20
