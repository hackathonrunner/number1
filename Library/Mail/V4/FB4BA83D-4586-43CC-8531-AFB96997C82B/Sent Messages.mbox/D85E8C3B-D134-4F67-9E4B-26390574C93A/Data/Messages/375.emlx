016.  Although we did receive the signed copy of your Stipulated Order of Co=
ntinuance, we have yet to receive the waiver of your presence.  Also, I need=
 verification that you have paid the court $100 administrative fee. I cannot=
 enter the Stipulated Order of Continuance until I have received both the si=
gned waiver and proof of the $100 being paid.=20
