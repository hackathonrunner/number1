Hi, I ordered 100 23G needles with the 3ml syringes and I see the order has n=
ot shipped. I was billed for this order and it has been three days since I m=
ade it. These are going to be used for vet use and living in Colorado, i do n=
ot believe I need a script. Is this the case or has the ordered not shipped y=
et because I have not sent in an RX? I haven't had problems buying these fro=
m other sources so I am confused. Thank you!
