Hey Steve,

Glad to see that the store is back up and running with your new Alpha =
line. I was wanting to put in another order. I really enjoyed the GE-TM =
products when they were in stock but id like to try out your Alpha 6 =
line. If its in stock, i would like to place an order for two (2) 10ml =
vials of Sustenon, two (2) 10ml vials of the Alpha 6 DECA, and one (1) =
order of the dianabol tabs.=20

Im excited to try out your line of gear, Ive heard good things! =
Obviously im not sending cash to the same address anymore since you =
moved so let me know where to send the payment as soon as you can so i =
can send you the cash. =20=
