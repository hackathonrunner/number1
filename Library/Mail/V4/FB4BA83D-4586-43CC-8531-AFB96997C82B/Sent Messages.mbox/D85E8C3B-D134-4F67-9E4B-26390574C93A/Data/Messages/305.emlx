 added your accounting 203 class. My name is Austin Dreier and You told me t=
o send you an email to remind you to reopen the connect plus homework assign=
ments for all of last week so that I could complete them. I was finally able=
 to get my book and access code on Friday, and was able to successfully regi=
ster my account with the connect plus website for the homework assignments t=
oday (April 5th). I will do today's homework to the best of my ability and w=
ould like to complete the assignments from last week that I've missed as soo=
n as possible so I don't fall behind in the lesson. Thanks so much, see you o=
n Monday!
