I have actually decided to keep both of the Tiles that I listed in my origin=
al email, but I would still like them to be removed from my account so they a=
re no longer shown on my list of activated Tiles. I would like to keep them s=
o that I can possibly give them away at a later date but no longer want them=
 to be activated. Will you please deactivate/delete/remove them from my acco=
unt so that they are no longer listed as Tiles that I am currently using? Th=
e email address that is associated with the two Tiles I have requested to be=
 removed from my account is austindreier@icloud.com=20

I really would like for this to be done as soon as possible, so if there is a=
nything more that I need to do, please let me know asap so that we can compl=
ete the process of having them removed. Thank you!
