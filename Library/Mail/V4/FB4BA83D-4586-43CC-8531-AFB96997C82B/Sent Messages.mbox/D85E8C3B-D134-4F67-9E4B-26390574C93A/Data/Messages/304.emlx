I just wanted to touch base with you and let you know that I just recently a=
dded your accounting 203 class. My name is Austin Dreier and You told me to s=
end you an email to remind you to reopen the connect plus homework assignmen=
ts for all of last week so that I could complete them. I was finally able to=
 get my book and access code on Friday, and was able to successfully registe=
r my account with the connect plus website for the homework assignments toda=
y (April 5th). I will do today's homework to the best of my ability and woul=
d like to complete the assignments from last week that I've missed as soon a=
s possible so I don't fall behind in the lesson. Thanks so much, see you on M=
