Hey thanks for the reply back. I think that we can work it out so that it is=
 anywhere for $12-$15 a shirt. I don't see that being a problem. And thanks f=
or showing me that forum post, I share my jeep with my brother and he is not=
 the best driver in my opinion so he has probably been driving to fast, as I=
 know that I like to go slow over those bumps so I don't mess up my suspensi=
on. I will talk to him and make sure he knows that people are complaining. I=
'll be in touch regarding polo shirts and figure out an exact price for you a=
s well. Thanks!
