Hi Ray,

I tried to call but you were busy so I thought I'd just send you an email. I=
 have a question about traveling out of state. Both my parents are traveling=
 to Seattle tomorrow morning to visit cousins and I was invited to go just n=
ow because my dad has enough flyer miles to take me. What would I have to do=
 in order to go with them? I would be gone till the 1st of March but back in=
 time to go the appointment I have with creative counseling. I am not going t=
o leave the state without you knowing or your permission, I don't want there=
 to be any problems. If you could get back to me as soon as possible that wo=
uld be great so that I can confirm my flight reservation. Anyway, thank you!=
