Hey I saw your ad for the iPhone. If it is really unlocked, I'd love to meet=
 up and buy it. Would you take $80.00 for it? If so, i could meet you anywhe=
re and pay you cash on the spot. I need a phone for my new business and it h=
as to be able to be used with Cricket Wireless. Please call or text me as so=
on as possible because I really need a phone fast! My cell number is 4043842=
344. I look forward to hearing from you!! Thanks!=20
