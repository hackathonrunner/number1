Hi Susan,

My name is Austin Dreier and I am a business student at Walla Walla Universi=
ty. I spoke with an employee of yours at the Walla Walla Airport Hertz branc=
h about a possible job position and also left a note with my name and phone n=
umber. I am a 3rd year sales and marketing student soon to be graduating and=
 would love an opportunity to speak with you about any open positions or int=
ernships you may have available here at your Walla Walla branch.=20

I was able to get your business card from the woman working the desk and tri=
ed giving you a call using the number listed on the card but there was no an=
swer and I wasn't able to leave a message because the voicemail box hasn't b=
een set up currently, so I thought I'd shoot you an email instead.=20

I am very interested in working for  Hertz, as it pertains mainly to sales a=
nd marketing the companies services. If you wouldn't mind giving me a call a=
t your earliest convince, my cell phone number is 404-384-2344, or you can e=
mail me back at austindreier@gmail.com. Feel free to contact me at anytime, n=
ight or day. If I don't answer it's probably because I'm in class so please j=
ust leave me a voicemail and I will respond as soon as I can.=20

Thank you for your time, and I eagerly await hearing back from you!=20
