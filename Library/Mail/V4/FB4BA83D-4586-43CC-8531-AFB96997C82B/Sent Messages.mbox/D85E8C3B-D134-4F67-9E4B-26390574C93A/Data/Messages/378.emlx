 a week, at 50+ hours a week. I would love to set up an interview to discuss=
 the position further. Please feel free to email me back or call me anytime a=
t 404 384 2344. I will also send a copy of my resume in a separate email so t=
hat you can see my previous work experience. Thank you so much! =20
