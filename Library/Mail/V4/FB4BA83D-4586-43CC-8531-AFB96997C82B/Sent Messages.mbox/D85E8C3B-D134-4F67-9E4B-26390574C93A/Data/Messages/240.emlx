Hi, I saw you as on Craig's list about the house for rent. I currently live a=
t the Xanadu apartment complex on burgess creek road and the bank owners are=
 condemning the building and require all the tenets to vacate the building w=
ithin 3 days. I am interested in the house and have the money to move in. Pl=
ease email me back at your earliest conscience so we can set up a showing if=
 the home is still available. Thank you!=20
