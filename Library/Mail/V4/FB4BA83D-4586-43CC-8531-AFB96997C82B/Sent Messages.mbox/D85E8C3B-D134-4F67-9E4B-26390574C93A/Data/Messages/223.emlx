I may have missed the announcement, so I'm just making sure, but did not hav=
e class today? When I walked to the classroom it was locked up, though I was=
 under the impression peer reviews for our final draft was scheduled for tod=
ay. I was terribly ill last week so I missed class, but I have a doctors not=
e for you as well as all the assignments I couldn't turn in online.=20

Thank you!
