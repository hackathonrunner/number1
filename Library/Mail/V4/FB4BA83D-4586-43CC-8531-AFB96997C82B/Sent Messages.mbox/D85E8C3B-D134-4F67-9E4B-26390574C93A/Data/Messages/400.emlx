Well, I will be able to make a full payment to the courts once I receive my f=
irst pay check from my second job. I will be receiving that check on Friday,=
 May 20th, and can make the payment as early as that day, if I don't make th=
e payment on the 20th it will be made on the 21st first thing in the morning=
. I may be able to make the payment sooner than the 20th depending on if I r=
eceive my tax refund check before then, but If I don't receive it the paymen=
t will be made no later than May 20th. I apologize for the time it has taken=
 to get all of this done and finalized and I very much so appreciate all you=
r help and assistance!=20
