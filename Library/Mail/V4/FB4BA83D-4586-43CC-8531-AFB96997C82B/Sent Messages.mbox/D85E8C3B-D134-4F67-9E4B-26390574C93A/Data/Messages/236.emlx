Ok. Thank you for responding. Is there anyway this item can be shipped as so=
on as it is back in stock? I need these urgently and I was not notified that=
 it was out of stock until I emailed you asking where the item was.. Can I p=
ossibly have my shipping method upgraded to a faster delivery time. This has=
 become a large inconvenience for me as I purchased the item when the websit=
e said it was in stock. =20

<p>Austin,</p>
<p>It looks like this product has unfortunately gone on temporary back order from our supplier. We are expecting to have the product in within 1-2 weeks. If you wish to keep the order we can ship it for you as soon as it comes in, otherwise we would be able to fully credit your card for the balance paid. I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience.</p><br><hr>
