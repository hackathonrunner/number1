Hi I saw the ad on Craigslist and thought I would be excellent for the posit=
ion. I have worked as a master baker in the past and know first hand how imp=
ortant it is to have clean equipment such as hoods. I have experienced a bak=
ery fire due to a grease related incident and would love to be apart of a te=
am that combats those types of situations. I do believe I would be a valuabl=
e asset to your team and have full availability. I saw in the ad that any ap=
plicants with a DUI in the past 5 years should not apply. I do have a DUI bu=
t I received it 4 years ago. I wanted to apply anyway because I know I am a p=
erfect fit for this job. I had a very good friend of mine get injured In a g=
rease fire that was cause by dirty equipment at our place work and want to b=
e apart of a team that combats these types of problems in the future. I hope=
 you consider me as a future employee and would love to schedule an intervie=
w. I will send a copy of my resume in a separate email and look forward to h=
earing from you! Thank you!=20
