Hi, name is Austin and I am a student at Walla Walla university and am looki=
ng for a room to rent. I was previously living in an apartment in the Mounta=
in View university apartments on
E. Whitman dr. In College Place but about 3 weeks ago, my apartment was burn=
ed in a massive fire that destroyed the whole complex. I am desperately in n=
eed of a place to rent because I have been bouncing around on my friends cou=
ch to have a place to sleep since my apartment fire. I have all the money ne=
eded for rent and can pay rent upfront in cash! My cell phone number is 404-=
384-2344, please call or text as soon as can, I look forward to hearing back=
 from you! Thanks!!
