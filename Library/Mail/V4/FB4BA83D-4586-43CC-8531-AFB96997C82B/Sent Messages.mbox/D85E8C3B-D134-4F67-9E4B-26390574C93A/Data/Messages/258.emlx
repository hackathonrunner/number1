Hey Steve have you received the letter package from fedex yet? They screwed u=
p your address and called me from Irving Texas trying to get a correction.  I=
 guess the fed ex guy printed it out wrong on the package. So I told them th=
e correct address and they said they would re direct it. That was on Tuesday=
, the day you were supposed to get the money.=20
