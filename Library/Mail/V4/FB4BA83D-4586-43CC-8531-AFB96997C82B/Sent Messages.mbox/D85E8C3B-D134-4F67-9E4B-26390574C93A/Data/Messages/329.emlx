Hey Dr. Smart,

I had a question for you. I am supposed to be meeting with Dr. Z in three we=
eks for my spinal injection follow up, and was trying to get a hold of him t=
his last Friday so that I could schedule an appointment this Monday with him=
 so I can get a refill on my medication since I will be running out in a cou=
ple of days. I was informed today though that he is going to be out of the o=
ffice until the 3rd of August. Would it be possible for you to write me a re=
fill again so that I do not run out before my appointment with him? Or shoul=
d I try and schedule an appointment with Dr. Moore or somebody at the clinic=
. I'm sorry for troubling you with this again, it's just very difficult to g=
et a hold of all these different doctors when I need them. I should have jus=
t asked you to do it when I saw you last on Thursday but I figured I would b=
e able to meet with him on Monday. Anyway, thanks again.=20
